# JavaLearningJourney

Welcome to my Java Learning Journey! This repository is my personal space to document and share my progress as I delve into the fascinating world of Java programming. Having a foundation in PHP, especially with Laravel, my journey will predominantly feature comparisons between Java and PHP/Laravel, aiming to explore and understand the nuances of Java through the lens of a PHP background.

Much of my learning is inspired by and sourced from [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com), a renowned platform known for its comprehensive tutorials and articles on Java. Baeldung's resources have been instrumental in guiding my understanding of Java's core concepts, advanced features, and best practices.

Inside this repository, you'll find a collection of code snippets, projects, and personal notes. These materials represent my ongoing efforts to grasp Java, drawing parallels and contrasts with PHP/Laravel where applicable. This approach not only aids in my learning but also serves as a unique repository of knowledge for others who might be transitioning from PHP to Java.

Join me on this adventure as I grow as a Java developer, one line of code at a time, leveraging the rich resources of Baeldung and my PHP/Laravel experience to forge a deep and practical understanding of Java.
